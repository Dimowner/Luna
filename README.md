# Luna
Completely free and open source (GPLv3) weather application for Android powered by OpenWeatherMap service.

# Features
Luna is very easy in use. 
It picks your location and provides current weather data and 16 day forecast for your place. 
Fairly simple and you always gets actual weather data no matter where you are. And Luna also optimized for Android M permissions model!

# How-to
Launch an application to see current weather data. You can tap on Temperature TextView to see 16 days forecast and you can even tap on each item in the list to see more detailed weather for selected day.

# Project status
Unfortunately this project currently in frozen state. The app works, signed apks available in the release section, but I don't have the time to maintain it on my own.
But you can make this app better. Feel free to fork this repo and of course pull requests are welcome!
